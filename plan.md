provided a JSON file of items to do that specifies the name, date, importance, estimated length in minutes (optional) and school subject/type of assignment.

All are string values except for importance, which is denoted in importance on a scale of 1-5 (1 being least important, 5 being most).

In addition to being able to use a pre-provided JSON file, you can also manually add assignments.
